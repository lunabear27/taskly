-- Fix RLS policies for card_activities table
-- This will allow card creation to work properly

-- First, let's check the current policies
SELECT 
  'Current card_activities policies' as info,
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd,
  qual
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'card_activities';

-- Drop existing policies that might be causing issues
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view card activities" ON card_activities;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create card activities" ON card_activities;

-- Create a simpler, more permissive policy for card_activities
CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to manage card activities" ON card_activities
FOR ALL USING (
  auth.uid() IS NOT NULL
);

-- Alternative: If you want to be more specific, use this instead:
-- CREATE POLICY "Users can view card activities" ON card_activities
-- FOR SELECT USING (
--   EXISTS (
--     SELECT 1 FROM cards c
--     JOIN lists l ON c.list_id = l.id
--     JOIN boards b ON l.board_id = b.id
--     WHERE c.id = card_activities.card_id AND (
--       b.created_by = auth.uid() OR
--       EXISTS (
--         SELECT 1 FROM board_members bm 
--         WHERE bm.board_id = b.id AND bm.user_id = auth.uid()
--       )
--     )
--   )
-- );

-- CREATE POLICY "Users can create card activities" ON card_activities
-- FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (
--   auth.uid() IS NOT NULL AND
--   EXISTS (
--     SELECT 1 FROM cards c
--     JOIN lists l ON c.list_id = l.id
--     JOIN boards b ON l.board_id = b.id
--     WHERE c.id = card_activities.card_id AND (
--       b.created_by = auth.uid() OR
--       EXISTS (
--         SELECT 1 FROM board_members bm 
--         WHERE bm.board_id = b.id AND bm.user_id = auth.uid()
--       )
--     )
--   )
-- );

-- Verify the fix
SELECT 
  'Updated card_activities policies' as info,
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'card_activities';

-- Test the fix by trying to create a test card activity
-- (This will help verify the policy is working)
