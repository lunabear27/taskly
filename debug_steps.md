# Debug Steps for Board Visibility Issue

## Step 1: Apply Emergency Fix

1. Copy and paste the entire `emergency_fix.sql` file into your Supabase SQL editor
2. Run it to make all policies completely permissive
3. This will allow all authenticated users to see all boards (temporarily)

## Step 2: Test Board Visibility

1. **Sign out** of both accounts
2. **Sign in** with `mjdialogo1@gmail.com`
3. **Check dashboard** - you should now see ALL boards (including ones from other accounts)
4. If you still don't see any boards, there's a different issue

## Step 3: Check Browser Console

1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Go to the Console tab
3. Refresh the dashboard page
4. Look for any error messages
5. Share any errors you see

## Step 4: Test Board Creation

1. Try creating a new board
2. See if it appears in the dashboard
3. Check if you can access the board

## Step 5: Check Database Directly

Run this SQL in Supabase to see what's in the database:

```sql
-- Check if boards exist
SELECT
  id,
  title,
  created_by,
  is_public,
  created_at
FROM boards
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check if board members exist
SELECT
  board_id,
  user_id,
  role,
  created_at
FROM board_members
ORDER BY created_at DESC;

-- Check current user
SELECT
  'Current user ID:' as info,
  auth.uid() as user_id;
```

## Step 6: If Emergency Fix Works

If you can see boards after the emergency fix, the issue was with the RLS policies. We can then apply a proper fix.

## Step 7: If Emergency Fix Doesn't Work

If you still can't see boards even with completely permissive policies, the issue might be:

1. **No boards exist** in the database
2. **Authentication issue** - user not properly authenticated
3. **Frontend issue** - problem with the React code
4. **Network issue** - API calls failing

## Step 8: Create Test Board

If no boards exist, try creating one:

1. Go to the dashboard
2. Click "Create Board" or similar button
3. Fill in the details and create a board
4. See if it appears

## Step 9: Check Network Tab

1. Open browser developer tools
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Refresh the dashboard
4. Look for API calls to Supabase
5. Check if they're successful (200 status) or failing

## Step 10: Share Results

Please share:

1. What you see after running the emergency fix
2. Any error messages from the console
3. Results from the database queries
4. Whether you can create new boards

This will help us identify the exact issue and fix it properly.
