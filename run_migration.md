# Database Migration Instructions

## Step 1: Run the Migration

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `add_last_opened_at.sql`
4. Run the migration

## Step 2: Test the New Features

1. Create a new board - you should be redirected to it immediately
2. Open different boards - the "Last Opened" time should update
3. Sort boards by "Last Opened" - most recently opened boards should appear first
4. Check that new boards show creation date until they're opened

## What This Migration Does:

- Adds `last_opened_at` field to boards table
- Sets existing boards to have `last_opened_at = created_at`
- Creates an index for better performance
- Updates the sorting to prioritize last opened time
- Redirects users to new boards after creation
- Tracks when boards are accessed

## Benefits:

- ✅ Better user experience with immediate board access
- ✅ More accurate activity tracking
- ✅ Fallback to creation date for unused boards
- ✅ Improved sorting based on actual usage
