-- App-Level Data Isolation (Simple RLS + App Filtering)
-- Run this in your Supabase SQL editor

-- Step 1: Drop ALL existing policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable update for board owners" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable delete for board owners" ON boards;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view own boards" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert boards" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update own boards" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete own boards" ON boards;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can only view their own boards" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create boards" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own boards" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own boards" ON boards;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own boards only" ON boards;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can create boards" ON boards;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update members of their own boards only" ON board_members;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can remove members from their own boards only" ON board_members;

-- Step 2: Create simple, permissive policies (app handles filtering)

-- Boards Table - Simple permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON boards
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON boards
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable update for board owners" ON boards
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for board owners" ON boards
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Board Members Table - Simple permissive policies
CREATE POLICY "Enable read access for authenticated users" ON board_members
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable insert for authenticated users" ON board_members
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable update for authenticated users" ON board_members
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Enable delete for authenticated users" ON board_members
  FOR DELETE USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

-- Step 3: Test the setup
SELECT 
  'App-level isolation implemented!' as info,
  'RLS allows all authenticated users, app filters by user ID' as description;

-- Step 4: Verify policies
SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename IN ('boards', 'board_members')
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;
